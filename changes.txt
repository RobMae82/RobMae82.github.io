CHANGES OR UPDATES MADE BY MYSELF

1. Removed Portfolio section

2. Removed a Dropdwon Section in the later sidebar for a specific menu if needed, but not in my case

3. Added section heading as suggested by validator.w3.org as a 'Warning'

4. Updated my Skill with progress bar using Javascript #EXTRA

5. Added a link to 'My Counter and Skills' and set up pureCounter.js #EXTRA for reduced motion

6. Changed profile picture, as well background image in the landing page and the favicon icon

7. used swiper.js #EXTRA to have the carousel and set it to pause on load for accessibility. It starts on hover or click and pause onmouseleave

8. used Google Fonts and Bootstrap icons instead of Font Awesome #EXTRA

9. I used typed.js #EXTRA so for accessibility reason I set up it for screen reader and motion sensivity accordingly
(aria-hidden: true, span element with sr-only class and added css rules for it, plus set up prefers-reduced-motion in javascript)

10. used a HTML form with bootstrap features #EXTRA

11. Updated Google Map and edited the error #EXTRA

Error: The frameborder attribute on the iframe element is obsolete. Use CSS instead.
<iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d48389.78314118045!2d-74.006138!3d4…100%; height: 270px;" allowfullscreen="" loading="lazy" referrerpolicy="no-referrer-when-downgrade"></iframe>

that frameborder="0" is no longer valid HTML5. It was used in older HTML versions to remove the border around an iframe.

remove the frameborder attribute from the iframe and apply a border style via CSS

replaced:
frameborder="0"

with HTML:
<iframe class="map-frame" ...></iframe>
with CSS
.map-frame {
  border: none;
}
